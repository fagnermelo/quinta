quinta-arch static export (layout-faithful)

This package was generated from a browser-saved HTML snapshot and the Blogger theme XML.
- index.html: cleaned to use CDN/remote assets instead of missing local "quintã_files" folder.
- assets/css/overrides.css: responsive overrides to make the old fixed Bootstrap v2 grid stack on mobile.

Notes:
- Dynamic Blogger features (widgets manager, login/admin, etc.) were removed/ignored.
- Post content is static as captured in the snapshot.
